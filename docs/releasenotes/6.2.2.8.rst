Security
========

Added ImageFont.MAX_STRING_LENGTH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To protect against potential DOS attacks when using arbitrary strings as text
input, Pillow will now raise a ``ValueError`` if the number of characters
passed into ImageFont methods is over a certain limit,
:py:data:`PIL.ImageFont.MAX_STRING_LENGTH`.

This threshold can be changed by setting
:py:data:`PIL.ImageFont.MAX_STRING_LENGTH`. It can be disabled by setting
``ImageFont.MAX_STRING_LENGTH = None``.



This release addresses several critical CVEs.

:cve:`CVE-2023-44271`: An issue was discovered in Pillow before 10.0.0. It is a Denial of Service
    that uncontrollably allocates memory to process a given task, potentially causing a service to
    crash by having it run out of memory. This occurs for truetype in ImageFont when textlength in
    an ImageDraw instance operates on a long text argument.

Restricted environment keys for ImageMath.eval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:cve:`2023-50447`: If an attacker has control over the keys passed to the
``environment`` argument of :py:meth:`PIL.ImageMath.eval`, they may be able to execute
arbitrary code. To prevent this, keys matching the names of builtins and keys
containing double underscores will now raise a :py:exc:`ValueError`.
