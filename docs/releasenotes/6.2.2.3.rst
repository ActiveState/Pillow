CVE-2022-22817 Restrict builtins for ImageMath.eval()

To limit :py:class:`PIL.ImageMath` to working with images, Pillow will now restrict the
builtins available to :py:meth:`PIL.ImageMath.eval`. This will help prevent problems
arising if users evaluate arbitrary expressions, such as
``ImageMath.eval("exec(exit())")``.

CVE-2022-24303 Pillow before 9.0.1 allows attackers to delete files because spaces in temporary pathnames are mishandled.

A bunch of changes related to temporary files and race conditions are fixed
