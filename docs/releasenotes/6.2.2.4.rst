Security
========

This release addresses several critical CVEs.

:cve:`CVE-2021-25293`: There is an out-of-bounds read in ``SgiRleDecode.c``,
since Pillow 4.3.0.

:cve: `CVE-2021-25291`: An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. In TiffDecode.c, there is an out-of-bounds read in TiffreadRGBATile via invalid tile boundaries.

:cve: `CVE-2021-27921` : Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.

:cve: `CVE-2021-27922` : Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.

:cve: `CVE-2021-27923` : Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.

:cve: `CVE-2021-25290` : Fix negative size read in TiffDecode.c

:cve: `CVE-2021-23437` : Raise ValueError if color specifier is too long
