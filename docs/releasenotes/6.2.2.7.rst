Security
========

This release addresses several critical CVEs.

:cve:`CVE-2020-10177`: Pillow before 7.1.0 has multiple out-of-bounds reads in libImaging/FliDecode.c.

:cve:`CVE-2020-35655`: 4 Byte Read Overflow in SGIRleDecode.c, where the code was not correctly checking the offsets and length tables. Independently reported through Tidelift and Google's OSS-Fuzz. This vulnerability covers Pillow versions 4.3.0->8.0.1.

:cve:`CVE-2021-28678`: An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For BLP data, BlpImagePlugin did not properly check that reads (after jumping to file offsets) returned data. This could lead to a DoS where the decoder could be run a large number of times on empty data.

:cve:`CVE-2020-10378`: In libImaging/PcxDecode.c in Pillow before 7.1.0, an out-of-bounds read can occur when reading PCX files where state-&gt;shuffle is instructed to read beyond state-&gt;buffer.

:cve:`CVE-2020-10994`: In libImaging/Jpeg2KDecode.c in Pillow before 7.1.0, there are multiple out-of-bounds reads via a crafted JP2 file.

:cve:`CVE-2020-35655`: In Pillow before 8.1.0, SGIRleDecode has a 4-byte buffer over-read when decoding crafted SGI RLE image files because offsets and length tables are mishandled.

:cve:`CVE-2021-25292`: An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. The PDF parser allows a regular expression DoS (ReDoS) attack via a crafted PDF file because of a catastrophic backtracking regex.
